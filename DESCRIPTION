Description: Package enables the data simulation from different survival models (Cox, AFT, and AH models). The simulated data will have various levels of complexity according to the survival model considered. The implemented methods for the Cox model are described in Ralf Bender, Thomas Augustin, Maria Blettner (2004) <doi:10.1002/sim.2059>.
